A data sturcture is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it 
can be used efficiently 

We can talk about data -structures as:

1) Mathematicall /logical models  or Abstract datat types:

 * List 
    -store a given numbers of elements of any types
    - Read elements by position 
    - Modify elements at a position 
 * Array
    - storing similar data types

 * Linked List



2) Implementation



# Abstract Data types (ADTs)
 -define data and operations, but no Implementation.
    Array 
    Linked List
    stack 
    queue
    Tree
    Graph

    1) Logical view
    2) Operatons 
    3) Cost of Operatons
    4) Implementation
