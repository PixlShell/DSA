Construction of AVL Trees: Robot Arm Joint Control

Aim: To implement an AVL Tree to store and manage robotic joint data, ensuring balanced structure for efficient lookups and updates.
Problem Statement:
A robotic arm's joints are identified by a JointID and have a specific angle. Store this joint data in an AVL Tree, using JointID as the key. Perform a series of insertions and display the joints in sorted order. Identify and perform the necessary rotations to keep the tree balanced.
Input:
•	A sequence of (JointID, Angle) pairs to insert: e.g., (1, 30), (3, 90), (2, 60), (4, 120)
Output:
•	The Inorder traversal of the AVL tree after all insertions, showing JointID -> Angle.
•	A message confirming the type of rotation performed to balance the tree (e.g., "AVL Tree balanced using Left Rotation at node 1").
