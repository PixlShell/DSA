Binary Search: Search for Transaction

Aim: To implement the Binary Search algorithm for efficiently locating a transaction in a sorted list and to extend it for finding the nearest match.
Problem Statement:
A bank's transaction records are stored as timestamps (in HHMM format) in ascending order. Using Binary Search, find if a transaction exists at a specific time. If an exact match is not found, return the nearest transaction time.
Input:
•	A sorted list of transaction times: e.g., [930, 1000, 1130, 1400, 1600, 1800]
•	A single timestamp to search for: e.g., 1400
Output:
•	For exact match: "Transaction found at index 3"
•	For nearest match (if no exact): "No exact match found. Nearest transaction is at 1130"
