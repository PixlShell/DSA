Binomial Coefficient: AI Decision Tree Splits

Aim: To calculate the number of possible attribute combinations for splitting a node in an AI decision tree using the Binomial Coefficient.
Problem Statement:
In the construction of a decision tree, given n total attributes at a node, calculate how many possible ways there are to choose r attributes to form a split. The solution must use the formula for combinations (Binomial Coefficient).
Input:
•	Total number of attributes, n (e.g., 6)
•	Number of attributes to choose for a split, r (e.g., 2)
Output:
•	The number of possible split combinations: e.g., Possible split combinations = 15
