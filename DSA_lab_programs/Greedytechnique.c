Greedy Techniques: Robot Pathfinding on a 2D Grid

Aim: To implement a Greedy Algorithm for robot pathfinding, where the robot always moves to the adjacent cell with the minimum immediate cost.
Problem Statement:
A robot must move from a start cell to a destination cell on a 2D grid. Each cell has a non-negative cost (energy or time). Using a Greedy approach, at each step the robot moves to the nearest unvisited neighbor (up, down, left, right) with the smallest cost. The goal is to find a path to the destination, acknowledging that this method may not yield the globally optimal path.
Input:
•	A 2D grid representing cell costs.
•	Start cell coordinates.
•	Destination cell coordinates.
Output:
•	The path sequence of coordinates from start to destination.
•	The total cost of the path.
